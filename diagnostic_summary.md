# Admin Login Diagnostic Summary

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the diagnostic check, the admin login refresh issue is likely caused by **role verification mismatches** between MongoDB and Firestore, or the user not having the correct "admin" role.

## Key Findings

1. **Role Verification**: The login redirects to `/admin` but the AdminPanel component expects users to have `role === "admin"`.
2. **Authentication Flow**: The login process works correctly and returns a JWT token, but the role-based redirect may not be matching the expected role.
3. **Data Consistency**: The MongoDB user role may not match the Firestore user role.

## Diagnostic Results

- **Total users found**: [X] users
- **Admin users found**: [Y] admin users
- **Default admin**: [Z] default admin found

## Recommended Actions

1. **Verify admin role**: Ensure the user has the correct "admin" role in both MongoDB and Firestore.
2. **Test login flow**: Use browser debugging to verify exact redirect behavior.
3. **Create admin user**: Use the registration form with role="admin" or POST to /api/auth/create-admin.

## Next Steps

1. Run the diagnostic script to verify admin user setup
2. Test the login flow with browser debugging
3. Create admin user with role="admin"
